The code repository for my portfolio site.

[![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/jiefenn8/jiefenn8.github.io)](https://github.com/jiefenn8/jiefenn8.github.io/releases/latest)

## Description

This is the code repository for my personal portfolio where users can acquire  public information I have published relating to my information Technology career. The website also provide external source containing more about me as well as the ability to reach in contact with me.

## UX Design and Thought Process

During the design phase, I have considered the list of users that would be viewing my portfolio website and concluded at this time to opt for a simple yet responsive minimalist website. This approach would place emphasis on the information/content published on the website than the design so that the user can focus on the information and view them easily.

### User Cases

In the users' point of view, some of the main user cases can be identified below.

- Users want to easily acquire basic knowledge or summary of the individual.
- Users want to acquire further detailed information about the individual.
- Users want to search other external information about the individual.
- Users want to obtain information on how to contact the individual.

### Future Consideration

As I consider the portfolio as an ongoing project over time. I have noted that in the future, a change in the UX design to balance between the current minimalist design and aesthetics would be desirable once expertise in UX has matured.
