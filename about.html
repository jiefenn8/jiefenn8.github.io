          Growing up in New Zealand with a fascination in computers and software development, 
          I pursued after a formal education and graduated from Wellington Institute of Technology
          with a Bachelor of Information Technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          Engaging in problem solving to solve current world and business problems with IT is what 
          I love about software development. I have applied my skills including Java and Full Stack 
          to many groups and organisation to help solve unique IT challenges, ranging from data 
          processing tools for Semantic Web to a Full Stack Metadata Visualisation tool to enhance 
          the value of an organisation's data vault.
        </p>
        <p>
          During my career break, I have continued to engage my problem solving and learning in many 
          advance IT fields such as Semantic Graph with my open source projects. Such endeavors have 
          matured the skills I currently have as well as the chance to pick up new invaluable knowledge 
          and skills in open data and software automation that I can bring to a team.
        </p>
        <p>
          Resuming my career in IT, I am excited in continuing the journey ahead in securing a position 
          as a software developer. I am currently studying in multiple courses in Front End, Python and 
          ITSQB Testing with the aim of enhancing my expertise as a full stack developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          My career interest lies with an innovative company that values building better products for 
          consumers through Team building and continuous learning. I always look forward to bringing 
          the skills and expertise gained from previous experience to add to these values and grow 
          with them even more.
